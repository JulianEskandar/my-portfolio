Since a young age I have had a passion for learning, whcih I satistified through many avenues, often switching after achieving high understanding in each. In middle school I discovered my love for physics when my mom had me tested for eligibility, then enrolled me in Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth progam. My father also had me read books such as Sun Tzu's "The Art of War", at a young age which developed an interest in strategy, politics, game theory, and war. My love for physics, combined with a lifelong love for cars, and my new strategic interest, came together and fed a new obsession. Racing. I raced go karts at a local level, using my knowledge of physics to find opportunity and assymetry where others did not think to look, and employed stategic thinking and game theory to apply the openings I saw thanks to my understanding of physics. As a 17 year old, I eventually taught the art of racing to adults and children alike, drawing out opitmal racing lines on a whiteboard, and explaing them using physics. 

Then came my love for poker. As my understanding of mathmatics progress through highschool, and I continued my interest in game theory, I realised that poker combined both of them, along with a new area of study, psychology. I have always loved physics and math because it helped me to understand the physical world around me. But studying people, their behaviors, and thinking patterns, was a whole new dimension to me. These passions motivatied a multi year deep dive into poker and its components, providing me an opputunity to focus my love for learning, and energy that resulted.
