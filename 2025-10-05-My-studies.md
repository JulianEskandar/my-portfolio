I was born in New York but moved to Greenwich Connectecticut where I attended Greenwich Highschool. I acheived a 3.6 cumulitive GPA, and played Varsity rugby from Sophmore to Senior year. I then begain my College eductation as a mechanical engineering major at Fairfield University on an acedemic scholarship, where I also played Division 1 rugby. I realized I prefer the thinking process and theory of physics so I switched majors in my second semester. For my second year, I transferred to the University of Connecticut where I coninued my study of Physics as well as playing Rugby at the division 1 level. I am now in my last year on track to graduate in May, 2026.
